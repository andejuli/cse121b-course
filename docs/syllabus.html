    <h1>JavaScript Language</h1>
    <p>CSE 121b</p>
  </div>
</div>
	<h1>Syllabus</h1>
	<p>In this course you will see how the principles of programming you learned in CSE 110 and 111 are used to solve problems in your 
	discipline. To that end, all of your assignments in this class will come from your major discipline.</p>
	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>You must have successfully completed CSE 111.</p>
	<h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
	<p>You will need a laptop computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. The laptop must have sufficient hard drive space for the installation 
		of the JavaScript IDE, and toolset. Internet connectivity is also required. There is no text, all readings are found in iLearn.</p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
	<p>To successfully complete this course, you must be able to:
		<ol>
			<li>translate simple, well defined, discipline specific algorithms to JavaScript (Algorithm - a clear and complete set of instructions),</li>
			<li>create functions in JavaScript from well-defined descriptions,</li>
			<li>setup and be familiar with the development environment for JavaScript so you can write code to solve problems as part of courses in your discipline,</li>
			<li>write code using JavaScript specific syntax and style, including comments, and</li>
			<li>find help for how to use JavaScript syntax.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Course Structure</h3>
	<p>This is a block course. In weeks 1 â€“ 5 you will have assigned reading and a reading quiz, an interaction with other class members, 
		and a programming assignment. Week 6 is dedicated to you completing an appropriately sized project that applies the JavaScript expression of 
		the basic building blocks of programming and functions. The project is one selected and produced for your discipline. In week 7 you will report 
		on your evaluation of syntax help sources.
	</p>

	<h3>Assessments</h3>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>For weeks 1-5, you will be given one or more tasks to accomplish.</li>
			<li>Each weeks 1-5 you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have completed the tasks for this week and have a strong understanding 
				of the Javascript syntax and style we learned about this week. Also, after completing my solution to the task, I reviewed the provided solution to 
				learn from another way the task could be completed."</li>
			<li>For week 6 you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have completed my small project and have a strong understanding of all 
				the code I wrote. Also, I wrote the code using the JavaScript syntax and style."</li>
			<li>For week 7, you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have organized my thoughts and described, in writing, the results of 
				pondering what determines if a JavaScript information source is a quality or poor source."</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Gradee Calculation</h3>
	<p>There are two possible grades for this course, A or D. If you can honestly answer true for the statements for five or more of the weeks, your score 
	will be an A. If you are not honestly able to answer true for 5 or more weeks, your score will be a D.</p>
