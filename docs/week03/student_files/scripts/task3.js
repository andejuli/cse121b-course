/* Lesson 3 */

/* FUNCTIONS */

// Step 1: Using function declaration, define a function named add that takes two arguments, number1 and number2

// Step 2: In the function, return the sum of the parameters number1 and number2

// Step 3: Step 3: Using function declaration, define another function named addNumbers that gets the values of two HTML form controls with IDs of addend1 and addend2. Pass them to the add function

// Step 4: Assign the return value to an HTML form element with an ID of sum

// Step 5: Add a "click" event listener to the HTML button with an ID of addNumbers that calls the addNumbers function

// Step 6: Using function expressions, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named subtract and subtractNumbers and HTML form controls with IDs of minuend, subtrahend, difference and subtractNumbers

// Step 7: Using arrow functions, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named multiply and mulitplyNumbers and HTML form controls with IDs of factor1, factor2, product and multiplyNumbers

// Step 8: Using any of the three function declaration types, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named divide and divideNumbers and HTML form controls with IDs of dividend, divisor, quotient and divideNumbers

// Step 9: Test all of the mathematical functionality of the task3.html page.


/* BUILT-IN METHODS */

// Step 1: Declare and instantiate a variable of type Date to hold the current date

// Step 2: Declare a variable to hold the current year

// Step 3: Using the variable declared in Step 1, call the built-in getFullYear() method/function and assign it to the variable declared in Step 2

// Step 4: Assign the current year variable to an HTML form element with an ID of year
